--
-- However, as the code is now, that results in a bug. Here's a scenario for two failed builds,
-- both being reran at roughly the same time:
--
-- buildA: completes successfully, gets all builds by commit (A: Success, B: Failure)
-- buildB: completes successfully, gets all builds by commit (A: Success, B: Success),

-- buildA: resumes and tries to set the check to fail
--
-- With the changed mentioned above, the check would go through these states: Pending -> Success -> Fail.
--
-- As it is, buildA's thread would still attempt to set the check to CheckFail, but only if its current
-- state is CheckPending, which is not. So no change will happen, which is what we want.
